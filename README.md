<h3>Objective</h3>
<p> &nbsp; The objective of the Spam Detection project is to develop an effective and accurate machine learning model that can classify emails or text messages as either spam or legitimate. The project incorporates five different algorithms: Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The aim is to compare the performance of these algorithms and identify the most suitable approach for spam detection.</p>
